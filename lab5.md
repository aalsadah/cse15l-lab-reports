## Part 1 - Debugging Scenario

**Student:** Hello, I am working on a java program and a bash script that is supposed to take in the path of a text file and a query, and then return the line and its number of where that query appears into a new file called ```results.txt```. I am on a Windows operating software and I am using VS code for this project. Here are some screenshots of my Java program, my Bash script, and the file structure.

I have run into two bugs so far, the first one is that for some reason my code does not return the correct line number, I want my program to return the number of where the query appears in the original file, not in the new file. I hope the screenshots below demonstrates what I mean.
